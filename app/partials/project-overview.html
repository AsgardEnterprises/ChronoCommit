	<h1>When do countries commit the most?</h1>
	<p>We took a week's worth of commits from the <a href='http://githubarchive.org'>GitHub Archive</a> and found out where they came from and when they were done. Countries are coloured based on how many commits were done, relative to the country's maximum commits per hour.</p>

    <h1>When do countries commit the most?</h1>

    <p>We took a week's worth of commits from the <a href='http://githubarchive.org'>GitHub Archive</a> and found out where they came from and when they were done. Countries are coloured based on how many commits were done, relative to the country's maximum commits per hour.</p>

    <p>Data processing was completed with <a href='https://www.python.org/'>Python</a> and <a href='http://www.sqlite.org/'>SQLite</a>. The data is available in JSON format <a href='https://github.com/AsgardEnterprises/ChronoCommit/blob/master/app/assets/hourly_commits.json'>on our GitHub</a>. The visualisation uses <a href='http://datamaps.github.io/'>Datamaps</a> with support from <a href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a>.

    <p>This visualisation was created as part of the <a href='https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge'>Third Annual GitHub Data Challenge</a> because GitHub is awesome and so are public data sets. The project is on <a href='https://github.com/AsgardEnterprises/ChronoCommit'>GitHub</a> and we encourage you to poke around the code and contribute!</p>
